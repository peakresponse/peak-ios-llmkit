# LLMKit

LLMKit is an iOS Swift Package to provide a streamlined API for LLM interaction, both local (through [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) and [LLM.swift](https://github.com/eastriverlee/LLM.swift)) and remote.

Current remote LLM API supported is AWS Bedrock (through [aws-sdk-swift](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-swift)).

## Example

An example app demonstrating the usage of LLMKit is available at: https://github.com/peakresponse/peak-ios-llmkit-example
